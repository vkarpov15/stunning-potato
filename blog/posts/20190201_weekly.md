`rxjs@6.4.0`
------------

[RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/) is the leading implementation of observables, a [concurrency primitive that's a mix of a promise and a stream](http://thecodebarbarian.com/this-thanksgiving-im-thankful-for-observables). An observable is a stream with 3 events:

* `next`: the next bit of data is available
* `complete`: the operation is done
* `error`: the operation failed

The classic use case for an observable is a progress bar for a slow HTTP request. You can load data piece by piece from the server, emit progress in `next` events, and then emit a `complete` event when the request is done.

[RxJS 6.4](https://js.report/package/rxjs/6.4.0) introduces a couple small new features. The first is that [`mergeScan()`](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/mergeScan) now passes an `index` to the accumulator function. It's pretty interesting that RxJS is expanding `mergeScan()` after considering [removing it in RxJS 6](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/issues/2737#issuecomment-317873975).

```javascript
const { from } = require('rxjs');
const { mergeScan } = require('rxjs/operators');

const numbers$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

const factorial$ = numbers$.
  // `index` is undefined in RxJS 6.3
  pipe(mergeScan((acc, num, index) => from([{ index, cur: acc.cur * num }]), { cur: 1 }));

factorial$.subscribe(v => console.log(`${v.index}. ${v.cur}`));
```

The [`takeWhile` operator](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/takewhile.html) now also accepts an `inclusive` option. The `takeWhile(predicate)` operator transforms your observable to return all values _until_ `predicate()` returns a falsy value. With `inclusive: true`, it will also return the first value for which `predicate()` returned a falsy value.

```javascript
const { from } = require('rxjs');
const { takeWhile } = require('rxjs/operators');

const numbers$ = from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

const first3$ = numbers$.
  pipe(takeWhile(x => x < 3, true));

// Prints "1, 2, 3" because 3 is the first falsy predicate
first3$.subscribe(v => console.log(v));
```
