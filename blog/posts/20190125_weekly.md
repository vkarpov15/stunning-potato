`onetime@3.0.0`
---------------

[onetime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onetime) is [Sindre Sorhus'](https://github.com/sindresorhus) utility for memoization. Pass a function to `onetime()` and get back a function that only executes once. Subsequent calls are a no-op.

```javascript
const onetime = require('onetime');
const fn = onetime(() => console.log('ran'));

fn(); // Prints "ran"
fn(); // Doesn't print anything
fn(); // Also doesn't print anything
```

Making sure a function can only be called once is useful for frameworks that provide callbacks for end users to call. Think [Mocha's `done()` function](https://mochajs.org/#detects-multiple-calls-to-done) or [Express' `next()` function](http://expressjs.com/en/guide/writing-middleware.html).

[`onetime@3.0.0`](https://js.report/package/onetime/3.0.0) drops support for older versions of Node, and adds a `callCount()` function that returns the number of times a function was called. Internally, `callCount()` uses a [JavaScript WeakMap](https://js.report/package/onetime/3.0.0). For example:

```javascript
// Called `fn()` 3 times above
onetime.callCount(fn); // 3
```
