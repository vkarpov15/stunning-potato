Keeping your Node.js dependencies up to date is a real problem. Even the core
Node.js team is calling for ["building and documenting guidance, tools and processes that businesses can use to identify packages on which they depend"](https://medium.com/@nodejs/call-to-action-accelerating-node-js-growth-e4862bee2919). But then again, Node.js apps typically have hundreds or thousands of indirect dependencies. Do you really have time to watch your inbox like a hawk in case GitHub starts complaining about a "security vulnerability" in a [one-line dev dependency](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ci)? Is it even worth it for you to bump your `package-lock.json` to account for the recent release of `is-ci@2.0.0`, or are you falling victim to [Parkinson's law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)?

How Often Should You Update Dependencies?
-----------------------------------------

Tools like [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com/) and [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) are great, but they solve a low value problem. Bumping a dependency is easy. Figuring out whether it is worthwhile to do so is hard.

Upgrading dependencies always introduces some degree of risk. [Semver](https://semver.org/) indicates the package author's intent. Semver is is not a strict guarantee that a change won't break your code. For example, suppose you depend on v1.0.0 of a package 'foo'. The 'foo' package exports a class with a function `bar()`. Your code has a class that extends from `Foo` and adds a function `baz()`.

```javascript
const Foo = require('foo');

class MyFoo extends Foo {
  baz() { /* My custom `baz()` function */ }
}
```

Now, let's say there's a new release `foo@1.1.0` that introduces a cool `baz()` function which `bar()` calls. Now your class may no longer be compatible.

```javascript
class Foo {
  bar() { this.baz(); }

  baz() { console.log('Base'); }
}

class MyFoo extends Foo {
  baz() { console.log('Sub'); }
}

new MyFoo().bar(); // Prints "Sub"
```

So you wait to upgrade. But then there's a critical security flaw that is patched in `foo@1.4.2` and you're still using 1.0.0. So you're stuck either running a server with a potential DoS, or digging through all the changes between 1.0.0 and 1.4.2 to figure out where your code is incompatible.

There are two extremes here: using [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io/) and always merging the latest version, or pegging exact dependencies and never upgrading. What if, instead of either upgrading immediately or never, you upgraded your dependencies regularly, say every 6 months? Of course, if there's a critical security issue in a production dependency, you upgrade ASAP. But upgrading regularly helps make sure critical upgrades are not too painful.

December is a great time to run some upgrades, unless you work for Amazon and are slammed with people buying Holiday gifts. If business is slow in December, take some time to go through your `package.json` and upgrade to the latest version. Consider it a Christmas present for your future self.

`is-ci@2.0.0` and `ci-info@2.0.0`
---------------------------------

The [is-ci](https://www.npmjs.com/package/is-ci) package was the topic of the [tweet at the beginning of this article](https://twitter.com/HarshilShah1910/status/1068022214501388289/photo/1). Why on Earth is a one-line package so popular? The download count can be partially explained by [lerna 2.x](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerna/v/2.11.0) and [ava](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ava/v/1.0.0-rc.2), but not entirely. The biggest package that depends on `is-ci` is actually [husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky).

Before you write off `is-ci`, remember it not a library you can reasonably implement yourself. It is actually a convenient wrapper around the [`ci-info`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ci-info) package, which in turn tells you exactly which CI you're running on. Keeping track of all the CI providers out there is a daunting task. The [`ci-info@2.0.0` release](https://github.com/watson/ci-info/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v200) removed support for old Node.js versions and made [Microsoft Team Foundation Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_Foundation_Server) equivalent to [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/).

`react-redux@6.0.0`
-------------------

[React-redux 6.0.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v6.0.0) landed recently. The backwards breaking changes were minimal. Most notably, they dropped support for React < 16.4 because they started using the [React Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html). You can [read more here](https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/2018/11/react-redux-history-implementation/#v6-0).
