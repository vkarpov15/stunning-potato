[Sentry](https://sentry.io) has built a business around the idea that every error that happens in your system should have a permanent URL. Conventional error logs work well for catching recent errors, but what about if you want to link someone to an error that occurred days or months ago?

At JSReport, we're trying to do the same thing for changelogs. Some changelogs don't have headers that you can link to, like [ESLint's](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). You can find a link in the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/releases/tag/v5.10.0), but not all modules create GitHub releases or even use git tags. This inconsistency makes keeping track of the dozens of npm packages you depend on tricky. Here's our page for the [eslint@5.11.0 release](https://js.report/package/eslint/5.11.0) with the changelog.

`eslint@5.11.0`
---------------

`eslint@5.11.0` has [2 new features](https://js.report/package/eslint/5.11.0). One of the new features is a new rule [`no-useless-catch`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/docs/rules/no-useless-catch.md). This new rule disallows `catch` blocks that only rethrow the original error. For example:

```
/*eslint no-useless-catch: "error"*/

try {
  throw new Error('Oops!');
} catch (error) {
  throw error;
}
```

Running `eslint` on the above script will throw a nice handy error.

```
$ eslint --version
v5.11.1
$ eslint test.js

/test/test.js
  3:1  error  Unnecessary try/catch wrapper  no-useless-catch

âœ– 1 problem (1 error, 0 warnings)

$
```
