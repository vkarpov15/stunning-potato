Changelogs are one of the major reasons why we created JSReport. Finding what happened between two releases of an npm module is a hassle, so we created a tool that could glue together npm releases with [changelogs](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) on GitHub. Changelogs are supposed to help consumers of your software understand what upgrading from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1 means for them. As someone working on a software project, should you write changelogs on your own or use a tool like [standard-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/standard-changelog)?

Do You Write or Generate Changelogs?
------------------------------------

There are plenty of tools out there that will [automatically generate a changelog for you](http://thecodebarbarian.com/keeping-a-changelog-in-nodejs.html) based on your Git commit history. These tools are great for quickly generating changelogs as part of your release process: run `npm run release`, and your script can bump `package.json`, generate a changelog, and push your code up to GitHub to deploy. Sounds easy, right?

Now imagine you have a larger project. Say you have 5-10 contributors distributed around the world. Even if you get them to consistently follow [Angular structured commit guidelines](http://thecodebarbarian.com/keeping-a-changelog-in-nodejs.html#angular-style-structured-commits), Git commit messages are often not very user friendly. We've all had times when it's late at night and our commit messages are not very readable. Check out [this bad commit message generator](http://whatthecommit.com/) for a chuckle.

Furthermore, tools like standard-changelog don't have any support for custom ordering. The first commit after v1.0.0 and before v1.0.1 is the first one in the changelog regardless of significance. Let's face it, the further down in a changelog a note is, the less likely someone is to read it. Therefore, the most important changes be at the top of the changelog. [Don't bury the lead](https://dorieclark.com/dont-bury-the-lead/).

Changelogs are meant for consumers of your software. Git commit messages are meant for other developers on a project. Make sure you don't conflate the two. Changelog generators work well if you're one developer with many smaller projects. If your releases have a lot of changes and you're not able to ensure that your commit messages provide enough context, there's nothing wrong with writing your changelog by hand.

### moment

For better or worse, [moment](http://momentjs.com/) is the most popular date/time utility library on npm. [Moment v2.23.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment/v/2.23.0) was shipped on December 13. What changed? [Here's the full changelog on GitHub](https://gist.github.com/marwahaha/eadb7ac11b761290399a576f8b2419a5#moment-2230-changelog). This is an example of a changelog that appears to be generated automatically. The only new feature's description matches that of the [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/moment/moment/pull/4563).

The new feature adds support for adding and subtracting [ISO weeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date). The key difference between ISO weeks and normal moment weeks is that ISO weeks start on Monday, and moment weeks start on Sunday. This is a [problem for some users](https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/4518#issuecomment-397913182) because they would have to remember to use `startOf('isoWeek')` but `add(1, 'week')`

```javascript
moment().startOf('week').format('dddd'); // Sunday
moment().startOf('isoWeek').format('dddd'); // Monday

// v2.23.0 fixed this, because `.add(1, 'isoWeek')` was a no-op before
moment().startOf('isoWeek').add(1, 'isoWeek').isAfter(moment()); // false in < 2.23.0
```

Moving On
