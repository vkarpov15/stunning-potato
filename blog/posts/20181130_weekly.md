It's been a wild week in the JavaScript community with the [event-stream controversy](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/180565383195/details-about-the-event-stream-incident). A clever hacker offered to maintain the popular [event-stream](https://www.npmjs.com/package/event-stream) npm module, and pushed a patch release that added a [malicious dependency](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116?ref=hvper.com&utm_source=hvper.com&utm_medium=website#issue-382854428) designed to steal Bitcoin. The hacker then released a major version to cover their tracks. [This GitHub issue](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/116) was both entertaining and a little terrifying.

Vet and Track Your Dependencies
-------------------------------

Many devs in this thread made the point that, since most OSS licenses don't provide a warranty, the responsibility falls on the consumer to verify the security of their code. For example, here's [TJ's](https://github.com/tj) comments:

The question is, how are you supposed to vet your code when you have hundreds of upstream dependencies? As a consumer, how do you even find out about new releases that affect you? Most developers don't rely on event-stream directly, the most likely entry point would be [gulp `<= 3.2.4`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp/v/3.2.4) and several [gulp plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-livereload). The hacker disguised this change as [fixing a long outstanding feature request](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream/issues/73) by adding a new package. So how do you check whether a dependency 2 levels removed from gulp is stealing your Bitcoin?

Here's a full list of the most recent releases for packages with more than 100k monthly downloads that depend on the [compromised event-stream@3.3.6](https://js.report/package/event-stream/3.3.6).

At JSReport, we're working to make tracking what's going on in your `./node_modules` as easy as keeping up with the news. Our first product is our [Slack integration](https://js.report/slack) that posts new releases, with changelogs, to a Slack channel in realtime. Next up, we're working on adding support for notifying your of releases to upstream dependencies in your semver range, and a weekly email integration for people who think Slack is too noisy.

snapdragon-node@3.0.0
---------------------

You might be surprised that [this week's biggest major release](https://github.com/here-be/snapdragon-node/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#300---2018-11-24) is a package that you've probably never used directly. The snapdragon-node module is a couple layers down from the popular [micromatch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/micromatch) glob matching library. If you use [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack) or [stylelint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint), snapdragon-node is 4 levels down: webpack -> micromatch -> [snapdragon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snapdragon) -> [snapdragon-node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snapdragon-node). Don't panic, `snapdragon-node@3.0.0` is [not in snapdragon's semver range](https://github.com/here-be/snapdragon/blob/82fb20dc905ac0e22061ffaabaced311f296d4cd/package.json#L35), so this release won't cause the next [webpack `npm install` breakage](https://github.com/isaacs/node-graceful-fs/issues/139).

However, this release highlights the challenge in vetting your npm dependencies on an ongoing basis. If there's a major release 4 layers down, some module may use `*` or `>=` and break your code [even if you don't use semver ranges in `package.json`](http://thecodebarbarian.com/node-static-a-semver-parable.html).

qs@6.6.0
--------

The [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs) module is the query string parser [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) uses. Express [pegs an exact version of qs](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/dc538f6e810bd462c98ee7e6aae24c64d4b1da93/package.json#L50), so this release also likely will not affect you.

The primary new feature in this release is a new flag adding [support for old Internet Explorer form encodings](https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/268/files#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8).

```
$ npm install qs@6.6.0
$ node
> const qs = require('qs')
undefined
> qs.parse('a=%A7')
{ a: '%A7' }
> qs.parse('a=%A7', { charset: 'iso-8859-1' }) // New in 6.6.0
{ a: 'ยง' }
>
```

Moving On
---------

Event-stream not withstanding, this was a quiet week on npm with only 37,782 new releases between November 23 and November 30. How many of those affect you? Check out [JSReport for Slack](https://js.report/slack) and keep up to date with the JavaScript libraries you depend on.
