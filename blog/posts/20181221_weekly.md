If you host Node.js projects on GitHub, odds are you've seen these emails:

And these alerts on your GitHub repos:

Unfortunately, fixing these alerts can be a pain because these alerts often
packages that you don't depend on directly. For example, the [mongoose-throw-unselected](https://github.com/mongoosejs/mongoose-throw-unselected) package had the below security vulnerability alerts:

<img class="outlined" src="https://i.imgur.com/4E3x102.png">

But neither `bson` nor `minimatch` is in `package.json`:

```
"devDependencies": {
  "acquit": "1.0.0",
  "acquit-ignore": "0.0.3",
  "acquit-markdown": "0.1.0",
  "istanbul": "0.4.2",
  "mocha": "5.x",
  "mongodb": "~2.2.9",
  "mongoose": "5.x"
}
```

Figuring Out What Packages to Update
------------------------------------

The security alert is due to the fact that `mongodb@2.2.9` depends on `mongodb-core@2.0.11`, which in turn depends on [`bson@~0.5.4`](https://github.com/mongodb-js/mongodb-core/blob/bf2755ceae7d3fcc5895ed7fcd28bd3dc114f36a/package.json#L19). The `minimatch` vulnerability comes from `istanbul@0.4.2` -> `fileset@0.2.1` -> `minimatch@2.0.10`.

These vulnerabilities are DoS vulnerabilities (see [bson](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-13863), [minimatch](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-10540)) in dev dependencies, so they are not exploitable. [ReDoS vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS) allow a malicious user to send a bad regular expression that grinds your server to a halt, but in the vulnerable code only runs when executing tests.

How do you figure out what packages you need to update to make these security alerts go away? There isn't any established tooling for this. We just use [`npm list`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/ls.html). Running the below command gives you a `list.out` file with your entire dependency tree:

```
npm list > list.out
```

The `list.out` file looks like this:

```
mongoose-throw-unselected@0.1.2
├─┬ acquit@1.0.0
│ ├── esprima@4.0.0
│ ├── lodash@4.17.5
│ └── marked@0.3.9
├── acquit-ignore@0.0.3
├─┬ acquit-markdown@0.1.0
│ └── commander@2.13.0
├─┬ istanbul@0.4.2
```

You can then use vim or whichever text editor you prefer to find what top-level dependencies depend on compromised versions.

How do you find what packages you need to upgrade due to security vulnerabilities? Leave a note in the comments!

`webpack@4.28.0`
----------------

Webpack keeps its [changelog in GitHub tags](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v4.28.0). 4.28.0 is a small release in preparation for the [upcoming Webpack 5 release](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/releases/tag/v5.0.0-alpha.0).

Want to know why changelogs are so important? Here's the [full GitHub diff between v4.28.0 and v4.27.1](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/compare/4056506488c1e071dfc9a0127daa61bf531170bf...e871eeb121a69efd6cbfa56f977d5843bf030202). 76 file changes and 1564 SLOC delta. This isn't very accessible to the casual observer.

The changelog makes this much easier to understand. This release's only
new feature is a new parameter to [IgnorePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/ignore-plugin/). Suppose you have two simple JS files, `foo.js` and `bar.js`:

```javascript
const bar = require('./bar');
```

```javascript
module.exports = 'bar';
```

The below script demonstrates the new parameter for `IgnorePlugin`'s `checkResource()` function:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');

const plugin = new webpack.IgnorePlugin({
  checkContext(context) {
    return false;
  },
  checkResource(resource, context) {
    // Before 4.28.0, `context` would be undefined
    // In `>= 4.28.0`, `context` contains the current dir
    console.log(resource, context);
    return false;
  }
});

const config = {
  entry: ['./foo.js'],
  plugins: [plugin]
};

webpack(config, (err, res) => {
  if (err) {
    return console.log(err);
  }
  console.log('done');
});
```

The above script will print:

```
$ node test.js
./foo.js /home/workspace
./bar /home/workspace
done
```

Moving On
---------

There were 67,747 new releases between December 14 and December 21. How many of those affect you? Check out [JSReport for Slack](https://js.report/slack) and keep up to date with the JavaScript libraries you depend on.
