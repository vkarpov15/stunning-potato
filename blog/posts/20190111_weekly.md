`tough-cookie@3.0.0`
--------------------

`tough-cookie` is a cookie store used by several popular modules, including [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) and [jsdom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom) (which in turn is used by [jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest), etc.). [Here's the full diff between the two versions](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/compare/v2.5.0...v3.0.0). Tough-cookie does **not** keep a changelog.

The most significant change is that tough-cookie dropped support for Node.js 0.8, 0.10, 0.12, and 4. You need Node.js `>= 6.0.0`. The reason for dropping old Node.js support is because tough-cookie relies on [Node's native `net` library](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/125), which causes problems when using it in Node-like environments that don't have `net`.

In order to avoid using `net.isIP()` to check whether a string is an IP address, tough-cookie switched to using the [`ip-regex` module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ip-regex), which [requires Node.js 8.x](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ip-regex/blob/605041b6a32ac7cca8b9c827bb9abc34e9336be0/package.json#L13). This version inconsistency has [caused issues for people using Node.js 6](https://github.com/salesforce/tough-cookie/issues/140).
